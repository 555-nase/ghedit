	<h1>GHEdit</h1>
	GHEdit is a fast, rich, open source code editor that runs great in web browsers. It's directly integrated with GitHub so
	you can work on your projects without installing anything.
	<p>
		GHEdit is derived from Microsoft's <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com'>Visual Studio Code</a>. We developed it to
		learn about web-based development environments and think it is useful enough to share.
	</p>
	<h1>Features</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>GitHub integration (view and edit repositories and files)</li>
		<li>Complete project explorer and text editor</li>
		<li>Syntax highlighting and auto-complete for all major programming and markup languages</li>
		<li>IntelliSense for Javascript, TypeScript, JSON</li>
		<li>Project-wide search and replace</li>
		<li>Themes</li>

		<li>Customizable Keyboard Shortcuts</li>
		<li>Per-user, per-project customizable editor settings</li>
		<li><a href='https://github.com/spiffcode/ghcode'>Open Source!</a></li>
	</ul>

	We have not implemented all the major features of Visual Studio Code. These in particular:
	<ul>
		<li>Debugger</li>
		<li>Extensions</li>
		<li>Git integration</li>
		<li>Integrated Terminal</li>
		<li>Project-wide IntelliSense</li>
		<li>Task Runner</li>
		<li>Markdown Preview</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Usage</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Select one of your GitHub repositories to get started.</li>
		<li>Select a file for viewing/editing from the Explorer panel on the left.
		<li>Edit the file as you wish!</li>
		<li>Saved files are committed directly to GitHub.</li>
		<li>If you don't see your private repositories, sign out, check the "Include my private repositories" box, and sign back in again.</li>
		<li>Customize GHEdit User and Workspace Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Color Theme.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<p><b>Q: Why did you do it?</b></p>
	<p>A: We think Visual Studio Code is a great IDE and that Cloud IDEs have tremendous potential. We decided to see if VSCode
		could be adapted to run in the Cloud. It can!
	</p>
	<p><b>Q: How does it work?</b></p>
	<p>A: GHEdit runs entirely in the browser without server-side processing.
		It is hosted as a static GitHub Page and uses the GitHub API to read/write
		repositories and files. The only custom "back-end" is a
		<a href="https://github.com/spiffcode/ghcode/blob/master/auth-server/function.js">tiny Google Cloud Function</a>
		to facilitate the GitHub authorization process. User Settings are saved to a GitHub Gist.</p>
	<p><b>Q: What next?</b></p>
	<p>A: We've satisfied our curiosity and don't intend to take this project further. <a href='https://github.com/spiffcode/ghcode'>GHEdit is open source</a> for anyone who'd like to do so.</p>
	<p><b>Q: Why do I need to give GHEdit GitHub permissions?</b></p>
	<p>A: GHEdit needs permission to operate on your behalf and to not be throttled by GitHub API rate limits.</p>
	<p><b>Q: Go To Symbol, Go To Definition, and IntelliSense don't always seem to work. What's up with that?</b></p>
	<p>A: GHEdit can only perform these operations across open files :(.</p>
	<p><b>Q: What's your privacy policy?</b></p>
	<p>A: We don't retain any user information, including GitHub credentials. We use Google Analytics to monitor overall usage.</p>
